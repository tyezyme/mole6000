Make another prefab of the mole, then use that for the arcadeMoleMachine, and make the rise animation play on start.
Have the player be required to play whack a mole on it, then leave the arcade. Make a cutscene where the mole gets mad
and wants revenge. Then the player starts player again (spawns at the door always) and finds that the machine doesn't
work anymore. After that, the player goes to a room with buttons to fix the machines, but hears beeping and sees red lights
He goes to the main arcade hall and sees the giant mole trying to attack him.
